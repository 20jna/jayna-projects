**5. Exercise 6.18 (a) and (c).**

**a)** The estimate shape parameter is 2.670. The estimate rate parameter is 3.842.
```{r}
data(Service, package = "resampledata")

mean <- mean(Service$Time)
summation <- sum((Service$Time - mean)^2)
n <- 174

#estimate shape parameter
(shape_par <- mean^2/(summation/n))
  
#estimate rate parameter
(rate_par <- mean/(summation/n))
```

**c)** In the histogram, the majority of the distribution sits under the Method of Moments curve that is imposed. Also, the QQ Plot shows a relatively linear, positive correlation between the sample quantiles and theoretical quantities. This evidence suggests that the estimated distribution fits the data well.
```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
n <- dim(Service)[1] #sample size
r_hat <- shape_par # MoM estimate
lambda_hat <- rate_par # MoM estimate

#histogram
hist(Service$Times, main = "Distribution of Service Times
     w/ MoM Curve", xlab = "Service Times (minutes)", freq=FALSE)
curve(dgamma(x, shape = r_hat, rate = lambda_hat), col = "red", add = TRUE)

#qqplot
qqplot(Service$Times, qgamma(ppoints(n), shape = r_hat, rate = lambda_hat), 
       xlab = "Theoretical Quantiles", ylab = "Sample Quantiles", 
       main = "QQ Plot (6.18c)")
```
